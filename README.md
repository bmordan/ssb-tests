This is just my experiments to try and understand scuttlebot

## Usage

```
npm install && node ./lib/main.js
```

or if you have docker

```
docker-compose up
```

In this project I am trying to:

* create a scuttlebot that is a bot
* create a user feed
* have the bot and user follow each other
* have the bot place a welcome message in the user's feed
* have the user send messages to the bot and have a conversation
